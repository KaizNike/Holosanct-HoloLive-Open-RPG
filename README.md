## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide the gamedev community with a demo that shows how game systems work together in a complete 2D Godot game demo.

The demo draws inspiration from RPG Maker and older JRPGs like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest as well as the Godot 3 OpenRPG.

Throughout the project, heavy emphasis is to be placed on code that is...

- Updated to take advantage of what GDScript 4 has to offer.
- Simple, to best serve as a starting point for those diving into the project.
- Made to conform to GDQuest's [GDScript guidelines](https://gdquest.gitbook.io/gdquests-guidelines/godot-gdscript-guidelines).

## Our Mission

Together, we're creating a codebase and tools to show you some of the best practices to create:

- Turn-based games
- A combat system
- An inventory system
- Character progression
- User interface with multiple menus
